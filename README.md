Enhanced OOP345NBB-Notes Lecture Notes

This repo is just modified notes of https://github.com/Seneca-345305/OOP345NBB-Notes. I have added some explanation in form of comments for me where needed. All the comments of the files written with "/* */" tag are written by me.

You might see some URLs of the Notion pages in the comments. Which are from this notion website (Also written by me): https://plaid-success-bf7.notion.site/OOP-345-7a9f95024b6b407bba84cc462457cbd4
you might notice some of the explanation from ChatGPT, which I found to be more explanatory or I prompted GPT to generate in a way I found them to be more helpfull.
